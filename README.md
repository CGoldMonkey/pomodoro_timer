# Current Project: Pomodoro Timer Pairing Project
Making an Pomodoro clock which will count down to twenty-five minutes of work, indicate it is break time, count down five minutes, then start over again.  Can make the Session time and Break time adjustable. It will also have a Play, Pause, and Reset button.

## Skills Used
* CSS
* DOM manipulation
* Event Listeners

## Things That Can Be Improved Upon
* Have the Pause, Play, etc. buttons use icons.
